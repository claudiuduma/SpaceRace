# SpaceRace
Local multiplayer 2d race game where you race in space against friends or AI bots.
A competitive 2D racer where momentum management is the core skill. The game features a "frictionless" flight model: if you stop thrusting, you continue gliding indefinitely in your current direction.

The tracks are dynamic puzzles of risk and reward. Players must navigate around Deceleration Fields (beams that sap momentum) while looking for destructible walls that reveal faster, tighter routes.

Combat is designed to weaponize the drift mechanic. Players are equipped with blasters; a successful hit doesn't destroy the enemy, but momentarily disables their input. A stunned player cannot brake or turn—they are forced to drift helplessly along their current vector, often leading to catastrophic crashes or missed checkpoints.
